🚀 Hey, I'm Josh. I sling code in Swift and React Native, making apps that don't just work, but rock. 🤘

📱 Mobile dev is my jam. I do UIs in Swift and wrangle React Native without breaking a sweat. It's all in a day's work, fueled by good coffee. ☕️💻

🔧 Love fixing things up. Simple solutions to gnarly problems? That’s my kind of fun. And yeah, my desk's a bit of a creative chaos.

🎶 When not coding, I'm probably messing with music or AI. 

🤝 Got an idea? Let’s chat. We might end up creating something cool. 🚀
